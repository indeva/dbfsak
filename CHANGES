        * /dbfsak/CHANGES, /dbfsak/MANIFEST, /dbfsak/Makefile,
          /dbfsak/SOURCEFORGE-HOWTO: Version 3.4. Repaired bug caused by

          fields, which screwed up record dumps. Repaired bug that happens on
          the last field of records that are  "squeezed" using the -t
          parameter; they had masses of trailing  whitespace.
